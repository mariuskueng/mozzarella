## Motivation

**Mozzarella** is a collaborative shopping-/what's in your fridge list app. Mozzarella aims to help the user keep track of what groceries he has in his fridge, which of these he should consume and what he needs to buy soon. Because of shared lists it's able to keep track of an entire household.

The idea originates from the problem that a family has several frigdes, freezers and kitchen cabinets with loads of stuff in it. It's super easy to loose track of what's already at home and should be consumed next. Otherwise you throw away way to much groceries.

With this you can easily save money and help the environment by not throwing away food.

## Features (v1)

In the first version the following features will be implemented:

- **Shared lists** with unlimited users. Invite everyone you want. For example a you can manage lists for ***at home***, ***weekend bbq***, or the ***birthday party***.
- **Item entries** in every lists. Each item has a title, a piece counter ***(how many apples do I have?)***, and an overview of all pieces ***(1 & 3 pound pack of ground meat)***
- **Due-date notifications** which inform you easily which items you should consume next.

##Â v2

Future improvments:

- **Item notifications** If a user makes a CRUD-action on items in a shared list all other users are getting notified about the recent changes.
