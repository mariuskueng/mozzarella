## Motivation

**Mozzarella** is a collaborative shopping-/what's in your fridge list app. Mozzarella aims to help the user keep track of what groceries he has in his fridge, which of these he should consume and what he needs to buy soon. Because of shared lists it's able to keep track of an entire household.

## Features (v1)

In the first version the following features will be implemented:

- **Shared lists** with unlimited users. Invite everyone you want. For example a you can manage lists for ***at home***, ***weekend bbq***, or the ***birthday party***.
- **Item entries** in every lists. Each item has a title, a piece counter ***(how many apples do I have?)***, and an overview of all pieces ***(1 & 3 pound pack of ground meat)***
- **Due-date notifications** which inform you easily which items you should consume next.
